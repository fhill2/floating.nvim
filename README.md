I have stopped maintaing this but I'll leave it available here for anyone still using it.

A lot of the features in this repo have been made redundant by upgrades to nvim win API, and with plugins like nui.nvim now available I don't see a need to maintain this!

If you are looking for a starting point to implement your own custom UI features I would check out these projects instead:

[neovim-ui](https://github.com/mjlbach/neovim-ui)
uses non native borders [popup.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/popup.nvim)
Floating win API using native borders [nui.nvim](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim)
